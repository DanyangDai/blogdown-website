The stock markets became highly volatile, as the GFC had worsen by the late-2018.\nFirst, we investigated effects of the GFC in the US to several countries separately for 3 periods, the pre-GFC, during-GFC, and post-GFC. Countries included for this research is the US, Japan, Mexico, and France. We used volatility index (VIX) of each countries’ representative stock market for showing effects of the GFC. S\u0026amp;P500 VIX for the US, Nikkei VIX for Japan, price VIX for Mexico, and CAC 40 VIX for France. Time Span for pre-GFC, during-GC, and post-GFC are Jan 2005-May 2007, Jun 2007-May 2009, and Jun 2009-Jun 2011 respectively. Due to difficulties of gathering data and time span requirements, we choose three countries other than the US, each countries as a representative for their located continent.\n","date":1540253520,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540253520,"objectID":"8f66d660a9a2edc2d08e68cc30f701f7","permalink":"/project/internal-project/","publishdate":"2018-10-23T00:12:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/internal-project/","section":"project","summary":"An Empircial Investigation into the Growing Global Financial Implications of China","tags":["Time series"],"title":"An Empirical Investigation into the Growing Global Financial Implications of China","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
